# Jaxb-and-Dozer
This is an example about how to use JAXB and the framework DOZER. I used a file to read a structure XML and after I translated this XML to an object Java using JAXB. After that, I transferred that class for other class using framework DOZER. Tecnologies used: Java 1.7 , Dozer 5.5.1, log4j 1.2.14

# JAXB
Java Architecture for XML Binding (JAXB) provides a fast and convenient way to bind XML schemas and Java representations, making it easy for Java developers to incorporate XML data and processing functions in Java applications. As part of this process, JAXB provides methods for unmarshalling (reading) XML instance documents into Java content trees, and then marshalling (writing) Java content trees back into XML instance documents. JAXB also provides a way to generate XML schema from Java objects.

# DOZER
Dozer is a Java Bean to Java Bean mapper that recursively copies data from one object to another. Typically, these Java Beans will be of different complex types.
Dozer supports simple property mapping, complex type mapping, bi-directional mapping, implicit-explicit mapping, as well as recursive mapping. This includes mapping collection attributes that also need mapping at the element level.
